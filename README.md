# OneUp

## 2nd Year Projects - Implementation

**N.B. Projects must be implemented using the Java Play Framework.**

**Java Play Framework**

- Develop a CRUD website using the Java Play Framework and in-memory
database for commercial or educational use.

- Use appropriate techniques for form validation and processing, testing and
security.
 - Adhere to web design and development standards.
 - Relevant topics will have been covered in WDD1 (Sem 3), SQAT (Sem 3)
and Information Security (Sem 4).

 - A certain level of technical support will be provided via workshops and an
online forum during the development phase.

**Please note:**

 - It is essential that each team member takes responsibility
for developing at least 3 key functions (e.g. CRUD) in order to meet the
minimum requirements of the implementation phase.

 - Please ensure that the final prototype is fully tested on the machines in the
lab well in advance of the project presentation.

 - Once the basic functionality of the prototype has been implemented the
team should try to extend the application by adding any relevant features
that would add value.

 - The proposed technical content of your project must be agreed up front
with your supervisor.
